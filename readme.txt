Generate Google and Google News Sitemaps for large websites by relying in cron
jobs.

== Description ==

When you have a large number os posts it's impossible to create sitemaps by
using the _pseudocron_ functionality or hooks like <code>save_post</code>. This
plugin will require a system cron schedule of any host to visit a secret URL
and trigger the sitemap dump procedure.

It splits the sitemaps into 50,000 URLs each, and also tries to stabilize the
memory usage during the run, doing small queries and using a limited buffer
to write the files.

If you don't have administration privileges over your server, you can use a
[cron job provider](http://www.google.com/search?q=cron+job+service) on the
Internet. If you do, please report your experience for the other users.

== Installation ==

1. Download and activate the plugin.
2. Make sure you web server user can write on the
   <code>wp-content/sitemaps</code> folder.
3. Go to the 'Settings > Sitemap Files Generator' page and test the generation
   using your secret link. You should see the sitemaps in your log file and status
   table.
4. Submit the <code>wp-content/sitemaps/index.xml</code> sitemap in Google
   Webmasters.
5. Schedule a cron job in your server or a [cron job
   provider](http://www.google.com/search?q=cron+job+service).
